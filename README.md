# Cyber-Physical-System-Music-and-Dementia-Innovation-Data-Mining
Our project partner, Apex Harmony Lodge (AHL), is a community committed to empowering lives affected by dementia. In week 2, AHL has showcased to us how Alzheimer’s patients react to music that is considered stimulating. Before music is introduced to the patient, they are only able to answer simple yes or no questions. However, after subjecting them to music that they are familiar with, their cognitive ability has improved drastically where some of them are able to recall their childhood times. Thus, it can be seen that music therapy activates cognitive and speech centres in the brain of these dementia patients.

# Project problem
*While music therapy has a positive impact on the dementia patient as they regain some cognitive ability, it is difficult to know exactly which of these songs are considered stimulating to the patient. 
*A person’s music taste could be different from another
*Time consuming to track which songs are stimulating by having volunteers to sit with the patients and observe their physical reactions
Physical reactions are also not always the best indicator for stimulation, which make it difficult to distinguish songs that are actually stimulating.


# Project Goal
In order to make this process more efficient and effective, we aim to produce a classification model which would be able to predict whether a song is considered stimulating or non-stimulating given a set of brain waves. Data that is collected from the EmotivePro headset would be used as input to various machine learning models. From the models used, we want to provide insights into any possible correlation between brain waves and music.
